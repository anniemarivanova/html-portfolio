<h1>Anna's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Here are some of my favorite movies that I have seen this year</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<br />
<p>I hadn't seen Forrest Gump up until this year! Can you believe that! Upon watching it, it instantly became one of my favorite movies ever and it made me feel so warm inside.</p>
<br />
<h3>Lady Bird</h3>
<br />
<p>LadyBird is a feel good story about a girl in high school who is struggling with her life and wants to go study in a college that is farther away. Her mother is not super happy about this decision and this reminded me of my own time in high school when I was applying to universities.</p>
<br />
<h3>The Joker</h3>
<br />
<p>I also hadn't seen The Joker until this year and I ended up liking it a lot. I think Joaquin's acting was phenomenal.</p>
